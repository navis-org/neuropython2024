# :fontawesome-solid-computer: Preparations

The workshop will consist of a mix of introductory talks for the individual Python packages and a number of interactive coding sessions - see the [Schedule](schedule.md) for details.

You are welcome to just cruise :sailboat: along but to make the most of it you will probably want to follow the coding and participate in the exercises on your own machine.

In general, we expect you to have at least basic familiarty with Python including the standard data science libraries such as [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) and
[`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

Most of the workshop will be using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) for interactive data analysis. Please see their website for install instructions.

In addition, we have prepared setup instructions for the four different Python packages we will be covering:
