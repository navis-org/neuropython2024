# :material-language-python: NeuroPython 2024

Welcome to NeuroPython 2024: _Analysis and Integration of Single-Cell Neuronal Data in Python_ :wave:

This is free two-day workshop introducing computational workflows for the analysis and integration of electrophysiological, morphological, and transcriptomic data of neurons using Python. We will cover the packages [`Pynapple`](https://github.com/pynapple-org/pynapple), [`NeMoS`](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/nemos), [`Navis`](https://github.com/navis-org/navis), and [`CAJAL`](https://github.com/CamaraLab/CAJAL), providing a hands-on experience with these tools using public Patch-clamp and Patch-seq datasets.
